Voting Machine using Verilog on FPGA

Overview
This project implements a simple voting machine using Verilog, designed to run on an FPGA. It allows users to cast votes for 4 candidates, tally the results, and display them in real-time.

Features
User Input: Supports buttons for each candidate.
Vote Counting: Automatically tallies votes.
Display Output: Results displayed on 7-segment displays or an LCD.
Debouncing Logic: Ensures accurate vote counting.

Hardware Requirements
FPGA Development Board (e.g., Xilinx)
Push buttons for voting
7-segment displays or an LCD for result output
Power supply and necessary connections

Software Requirements
Verilog-compatible synthesis tool (e.g., Xilinx Vivado)
Simulation tool (optional, e.g., ModelSim)
